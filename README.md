Image Generation API with FastAPI and Replicate
This project is a simple API for generating images based on text prompts using the Replicate API. It is built with FastAPI and provides endpoints to interact with the image generation service.

Features
Generate images based on a given text prompt using Replicate's API.
Simple API structure with clean, documented endpoints.
Easy to set up and deploy.
Requirements
Python 3.8+
Replicate API Key: Obtainable from Replicate.
FastAPI: A fast, modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-generation.git
cd image-generation
2. Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory to securely store your Replicate API key:

plaintext
Copy code
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_replicate_api_token"
Note: Replace "your_replicate_api_token" with the actual API key from your Replicate account. This is essential for accessing the image generation endpoint.

5. Run the Application
Use the following command to start the FastAPI application:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Endpoints
Generate Image
URL: /generate-image/

Method: POST

Description: Generates an image based on a text prompt.

Request Body:

json
Copy code
{
  "prompt": "A futuristic city skyline with flying cars",
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512
}
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "image_url": "https://replicate.com/api/models/stable-diffusion/image-url"
}
Example Usage
After starting the application, you can use curl or a tool like Postman to test the /generate-image/ endpoint.

Example using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate-image/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "A futuristic city skyline with flying cars", "width": 512, "height": 512}'

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI, which can be accessed at /docs on the running server. This allows you to view and test all the endpoints of your API in a user-friendly interface.

In this case, once you have the FastAPI application running, you can access the Swagger UI by going to:

Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

How to Use the Swagger UI:
Open the URL: Start your FastAPI server with uvicorn main:app --reload and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Explore Endpoints: The Swagger UI will list all available endpoints in your FastAPI application. For this project, you should see the /generate-image/ endpoint.

Test the Endpoint:

Click on the /generate-image/ endpoint.
Click the Try it out button.
Enter the JSON payload with your prompt, width, and height:
json
Copy code
{
  "prompt": "A futuristic city skyline with flying cars",
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512
}
Click Execute to send the request, and view the response directly in the UI.
Response: The response, including the image URL or any error message, will be displayed in the Responses section.
